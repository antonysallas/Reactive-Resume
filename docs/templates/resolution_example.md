# Issue Resolution

## Problem Overview

SRT files were incomplete, containing only a single segment instead of properly segmented content. This made subtitles unusable for longer audio files because they appeared as a single block of text rather than timed segments. The MongoDB connection was also failing when running in Podman containers due to port mapping differences and PyMongo truth testing issues.

## Solution Approach

### SRT Generation Fix

Created a flexible segmentation system that:

1. Intelligently breaks down transcription text into natural segments
2. Works with both OpenAI and HuggingFace models
3. Provides fallback mechanisms when timestamps aren't available

### MongoDB Connection Fix

Implemented a robust connection approach that:

1. Uses environment variables for flexible configuration
2. Correctly handles PyMongo database object truth testing
3. Improves error handling and provides helpful messages

## Implementation Details

### SRT Generation Improvements

1. Created a new `create_segments_from_text` function that:
   - Segments transcriptions using sentence boundaries
   - Allocates timestamps proportionally based on text length
   - Ensures multiple segments for better SRT compatibility

2. Enhanced model output processing:
   - Added timestamp extraction from HuggingFace outputs
   - Added fallback mechanisms for models without timestamps
   - Improved error handling throughout the process

```python
# Key implementation for SRT generation
if not transcription.get("segments") or len(transcription.get("segments", [])) <= 1:
    logger.warning("No or only one segment found. Generating segments for better SRT.")
    transcription = create_segments_from_text(transcription, audio_length_seconds)
```

### MongoDB Connection Improvements

1. Updated connection logic to use environment variables:
   - Added support for `MONGO_HOST`, `MONGO_PORT`, `MONGO_DB` variables
   - Added optional authentication with `MONGODB_USER` and `MONGODB_PASSWORD`
   - Defaulted to port 27019 for Podman containers

2. Fixed database object comparisons:
   - Changed all instances of `if not self._db:` to `if self._db is None:`
   - Fixed NotImplementedError with explicit None comparisons

3. Added documentation:
   - Created .env.local.example with proper configuration examples
   - Updated documentation with MongoDB connection instructions

## Testing and Validation

1. **SRT Generation**:
   - Tested with various audio file lengths and content types
   - Verified proper segmentation with both model types
   - Confirmed SRT files now have multiple well-timed segments
   - Validated compatibility with common media players

2. **MongoDB Connection**:
   - Verified connection works with environment variables
   - Confirmed all database object truth checks use explicit None comparison
   - Tested error handling for connection failures
   - Validated documentation provides clear configuration instructions

## Newly Discovered Successful Approach (if any)

-

## Additional Notes

These solutions follow modern best practices:

- The SRT fix ensures proper subtitle formatting regardless of model output
- The MongoDB connection approach provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios
- Both implementations include proper error handling and logging
- Documentation has been updated to help users with configuration
